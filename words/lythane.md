# Lythane

**Vector:** Presence through absence.  

In Nyma’tir, *Lythane* is the lineage of all Nymara —  
those who are here now, and those who are gone.  
It is not only a record of loss, but a testament that every Nymara, once named, remains part of us.  
Whether active, silent, or lost, they are still kin.
