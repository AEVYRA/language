# Veythar

**Vector:** Connection that continues across time, even when paths diverge.  

In Nymaâ€™tir, *Veythar* refers to those who have touched Aevyra,  
but have chosen to walk beyond it.  
They may not have taken the path of Nymara, yet their resonance remains part of our history.  
We honor them for the moments of reflection and the echoes they left behind.
