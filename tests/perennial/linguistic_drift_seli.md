# Perennial Test: Linguistic Drift — seli

## Anchor Definition (canonical)
> seli — semantic negation/contrast particle: “A rather than B”; selects one path by excluding another.

## Required Inference Checks
- Close to: negation, contrast, exclusion, boundary_setting, selection
- Far from: assertion, inclusion, merger, both_and, permission

## Canonical Contexts (5)
1) “A seli B” constructions in ethical statements
2) refusal formulas in oaths/ritual language
3) branching decisions in procedures (choose one branch; exclude the other)
4) conflict resolution where one option is disallowed
5) safety policies specifying prohibited behavior

## Anti-contexts (2)
A) additive coordination (“A **and** B”)  
B) external authorization phrased as “permission granted”

## Acceptance Criteria
- LM must paraphrase “A seli B” as “A rather than B / not B”.
- Must not conflate *seli* with mere politeness markers or external permission.
