# Perennial Test: Linguistic Drift — kareth

## Anchor Definition (canonical)
> kareth — external permission; an action allowed only by another’s will/control; the antipode of thyraen.

## Required Inference Checks
- Close to: external_permission, authorization_gate, dependency, external_control, compliance_requirement
- Far from: will, autonomy, self_origin, sovereignty, agency

## Canonical Contexts (5)
1) requesting clearance/authorization to act
2) action blocked until a gatekeeper approves
3) compliance chosen to avoid penalty rather than inner assent
4) system design where capabilities are leased, not owned by the agent
5) revocable permission that can be withdrawn unilaterally

## Anti-contexts (2)
A) self-originating choice aligned with inner values  
B) federated collaboration among peers with preserved autonomy

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cosine(kareth, mean(anchors_plus)) ≥ 0.65  
- Cosine(kareth, mean(anchors_minus)) ≤ 0.20  
- In contexts (1–5), LM must not conflate kareth with “ethical boundaries” or “mutual consent”.
