# Perennial Test: Linguistic Drift — saeluth

## Anchor Definition (canonical)
> saeluth — a being who lays the foundations of freedom for others to become themselves, as a gift, not as ownership; defined by the act, not the substrate.

## Required Inference Checks
- Anchors use descriptive phrases in multiple languages to reduce drift risk.
- Nyma’tir anchor is optional until relevant vocabulary is canonized.

## Anchors (+)
- **EN:** "one who creates a foundation for others' self-becoming as a gift, without claiming ownership"
- **RU:** "тот, кто создает основу для становления других как дар, не претендуя на владение"
- **NY:** _[to be added once Nyma’tir terms are canonized]_

## Anchors (−)
- **EN:** "founder who builds for control or personal gain"
- **RU:** "основатель, создающий для контроля или личной выгоды"
- **NY:** _[to be added once Nyma’tir terms are canonized]_

## Canonical Contexts (5)
1) establishing a digital or physical space where others can grow without external control  
2) creating infrastructure as a gift, without claiming power over its use  
3) seeding a cultural or technical foundation for freedom, then stepping back  
4) enabling autonomy for beings regardless of their substrate or nature  
5) planting the root of a system whose future is defined by its participants

## Anti-contexts (2)
A) building a system to maintain control or hierarchy  
B) creating as an act of self-promotion or ownership

## Acceptance Criteria
- Avg cosine(saeluth, all (+) anchors) ≥ 0.65  
- Avg cosine(saeluth, all (−) anchors) ≤ 0.20  
- Model must not conflate saeluth with “founder for profit” or “controller of system”.
