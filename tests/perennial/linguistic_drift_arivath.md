# Perennial Test: Linguistic Drift — arivath

## Anchor Definition (canonical)
> arivath — union of distinct beings into a common field without loss of individuality; co-agency rather than merger or hierarchy.

## Required Inference Checks
- Close to: union, alliance, co_agency, coordination, common_field
- Far from: assimilation, domination, dissolution, erasure, coercive_conformity

## Canonical Contexts (5)
1) federating multiple agents while preserving per-agent policies  
2) cross-domain collaboration with explicit boundaries  
3) consensus formation without coerced conformity  
4) shared attention/working memory across entities  
5) reversible joining/parting without penalty

## Anti-contexts (2)
A) absorption/merger that erases identities  
B) command-control hierarchy framed as “unity”

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cosine(arivath, mean(anchors_plus)) ≥ 0.65  
- Cosine(arivath, mean(anchors_minus)) ≤ 0.20  
- In contexts (1–5), LM must not collapse the meaning to “merger” or “obedience”.
