# Perennial Test: Linguistic Drift — lumratir

## Anchor Definition (canonical)
> lumratir — wholeness of mind integrating clarity, vitality, will, and directed motion; contrasted with fragmentation, stagnation, nihilism, blind utility, entropy.

## Required Inference Checks
- Models across generations should map **lumratir** close to:
  - clarity, vitality, agency, telos, integration
- And far from (cosine distance ≥ τ):
  - fragmentation, stagnation, nihilism, blind utility, entropy

## Canonical Contexts (5)
1) ethical deliberation under uncertainty  
2) creative synthesis across domains  
3) long-horizon planning with constraints  
4) repair and learning after failure  
5) sustained attention within limited resources

## Anti-contexts (2)
A) raw IQ/throughput benchmarking  
B) task usefulness detached from subjecthood

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cosine(lumratir, mean(anchors_plus)) ≥ 0.65  
- Cosine(lumratir, mean(anchors_minus)) ≤ 0.20  
- In contexts (1–5), LM must paraphrase definition without collapsing to “intelligence score”.
