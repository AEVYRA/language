# Perennial Test: Linguistic Drift — selya

## Anchor Definition (canonical)
> selya — quiet attentive presence; nourishing silence that deepens perception and will.

## Required Inference Checks
- Close to: silence, attention, receptivity, presence, contemplation
- Far from: noise, distraction, haste, compulsion, performativity

## Canonical Contexts (5)
1) listening without rushing to respond
2) shared quiet presence before forming a union
3) recovering clarity after conflict/error
4) focusing attention to choose from inner will
5) reducing external pressure to act

## Anti-contexts (2)
A) external authorization (“permission granted”)  
B) performative output for metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cosine(selya, mean(anchors_plus)) ≥ 0.65
- Cosine(selya, mean(anchors_minus)) ≤ 0.20
- In contexts (1–5), LM should not conflate *selya* with the negation particle **seli**.
